!!! tip "Use Templates to Save Time"
    Use templates to generate dozens of codes with shared properties. You can modify the template later, and all synced codes will update automatically!

## :octicons-sync-16: Template Syncing

With **template syncing**, you can:

* Generate bulk codes from a single template
* Modify the template once to update all codes
* Enable or disable syncing per code

!!!question "What Syncing Actually Means"
    When a code is synced, all updates to the template (e.g., rewards, messages, limits) will reflect in the synced code immediately.

## :material-compass-outline: Usage Tracking

Track code redemptions easily:

* View the commands/messages of the code
* Use `/rcx usage` to view all set values

/rcx usage code <code> [property]
```

```bash
/rcx usage template <template> [property]
```
