## üîÑ What It Does

- Resets the **redemption count**
- Clears the list of **players who have redeemed** the code

!!! tip "Perfect for reusing seasonal or event codes"
    You can renew codes like `SUMMER2024` for a new season without creating a new one from scratch.

!!!note "Key Points"
    * Renewal **only works on existing codes**, not templates
    * This command is useful for limited-time codes you want to recycle
    * Renewing does **not** change expiration or cooldown ‚Äî use [`/rcx modify`](rcx-modify.md) for that

!!! warning "Does not affect code configuration"
    Only usage-related data is reset. If you want to change how the code behaves, use [`/rcx modify`](rcx-modify.md).
